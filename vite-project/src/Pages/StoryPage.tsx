  { name: "All Good Things come from Gratitude!", desc: "<p>In the whirlwind of change that has swept through my life in the past three months, I find myself 650 kilometers away from the comforting embrace of home, embarking on a journey into independence for the very first time. It's a blend of excitement and nostalgia, tinged with the realization that this chapter of my life will remain unique and unrepeatable.</p><p>Amidst this newfound independence, I've come to cherish the small gestures from home that I once took for granted. Whether it's the thoughtfully packed lunch awaiting me each morning or the timely assistance in locating misplaced belongings (a testament to my clumsiness üôà), these seemingly insignificant acts now resonate deeply within me, serving as poignant reminders of the love and care that surround me. Yet, I can't help but acknowledge my oversight in expressing gratitude for these precious gestures.</p><p>The return to an empty room on weekends, devoid of the familiar sounds and laughter that once filled its walls, serves as a striking reminder of the void left in the absence of family. While weekends offer a brief respite from the hustle and bustle of the week, they also magnify the sense of solitude and longing for companionship.</p><p>The transition from dreaming of independence to experiencing it firsthand has been nothing short of eye-opening. Life away from home has taken on a mechanical rhythm, starkly contrasting with the warmth and familiarity of my childhood abode. However, amidst the challenges of separation, there lies a silver lining.</p><p>This newfound independence has provided ample opportunities for growth and self-discovery. From mastering the art of grocery shopping to cultivating healthier eating habits and improving my sleep routine, each step towards self-sufficiency marks a milestone in my personal journey. As I navigate the twists and turns of this new chapter, I find solace in the knowledge that every obstacle is a chance to learn, grow, and emerge stronger than before.</p>", dateTime: "16:39 17-03-2024" },
  { name: "Embracing Boundaries: A Journey to Self-Validation and Inner Peace", desc: "<p>Learning to assert boundaries is essential for personal and professional well-being. As a perpetual people-pleaser, I struggle to delineate where my boundaries lie, often finding myself unable to prevent others from encroaching on my privacy. Consequently, I frequently endure hurtful situations. Paradoxically, I prioritize others' happiness over my own, recognizing the toxicity of this behavior yet feeling powerless to change it. I am aware of my predicament, acknowledging the need to break free from this darkness to embrace the light, yet unsure of how to proceed. </p> <p>It's crucial to recognize that blindly trusting others can be perilous. Reminding myself frequently of the principle of reciprocity is essential: in this world, everything operates on a give-and-take basis. People generally act in their own self-interest, only engaging if they perceive personal benefit. Such individuals, though transparent in their motives, are preferable to those who masquerade as allies while harboring ulterior motives to undermine you. </p> <p>I tend to keep my true thoughts to myself, opting not to critique someone's attire even if I believe it doesn't flatter them. When inadvertently hurt by others, I instinctively minimize the pain, reassuring them it's alright, even if it's truly painful. Placing more value on relationships than material possessions, I easily forgive, even when my most prized belongings are damaged, attributing it to unintentional actions. Throughout this journey, I've grappled with feelings of inadequacy, seeking external validation and feeling incomplete. However, I've come to the realization that filling this void is solely my responsibility; ultimately, I am sufficient unto myself. Embracing this truth, I've found contentment in my own skin.</p><p>Gratitude flows from within as I reflect on the strength that has carried me through countless trials, the resilience that allowed me to endure in solitude. Thank you for persevering, for never relinquishing faith in people, in the essence of humanity, and in the enduring power of kindness. In this journey, I've discovered the most steadfast companion resides within - myself. Henceforth, I embrace the truth that my greatest ally, my best friend, is none other than the person I see in the mirror.</p>", dateTime: "17:49 03-04-2024" },
  { name: "Beyond the Classroom: An Engineering Saga", desc: "<p> An engineering odyssey spanning four transformative years has reached its conclusion. Originally planned as a four-year endeavor, the program was unexpectedly condensed to three and a half years due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The early days were marked by the ubiquitous presence of masks üò∑. Classes were attended with faces covered, and bags filled with sanitizers, wet wipes, and spare masks. Despite the challenges, these precautions added a unique element of novelty to the academic experience. Speaking discreetly ü§´ behind masks during lectures became a small but memorable adaptation. The shift to online learning brought its own set of adventures. Virtual classes often ran in the background while other tasks were managed, necessitating quick returns to the screen for roll calls üßè‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. These sessions, filled with often futile attempts to prolong them, became a distinctive part of the educational experience. A collective reluctance to return to in-person classes was evident in the long faces when the call to return came. One of the most memorable aspects of this period was the transformation in social interactions. Initially, the removal of face masks rendered individuals almost unrecognizable to one another. Ironically, as time passed, there was a growing sense of missing the anonymity the masks provided, allowing expressions and feelings to remain hidden. Thus, the freshman year unfolded in a series of unique and unprecedented events üìö‚ú®. </p> <p> The sophomore year marked a period of deeper connections and collaborative growth ü§ù. Group presentations and team projects fostered a sense of camaraderie, allowing classmates to discover each other‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses. This period was pivotal in identifying areas for improvement and learning how to leverage individual talents for collective success. Understanding the importance of opinions and the value of mutual support became central themes. During this period I realized that Success was no longer solely about achieving perfect scores üèÖ, but about uplifting others along the way üåü. This mindset shift underscored the significance of collaboration and mutual respect. Stable friendships began to form during this time, with bonds growing stronger as individuals connected on a deeper, more meaningful level. These friendships provided a sense of belonging and created a supportive network that would endure throughout the college journey and beyond üåê‚ú®. </p> <p> The pre-final year felt like a pivotal chapter, one that would in many ways define our future. If it needed a name, 'Finding Your Calling' would be fitting. Computer Science, being a buzzing field, offers numerous pathways: Cybersecurity, Full Stack Development, Front End Development, Back End Development, Data Science (sounds cool, right?üòé), Machine Learning, and more. Deciding which path to choose, where to start, and whether success was achievable were constant concerns that often left me feeling overwhelmed and confused. In the midst of this uncertainty and complexity, the year seemed to pass by in a blur. The confusion and complications were ever-present, but they also fueled a period of deep introspection and exploration.</p> <p> And then arrived the final year, deemed the deciding year, where the tension of placements engulfed everything. This year was consumed by relentless preparation for the impending tests and interviews. It's hard to articulate much about this period; it was a time dedicated entirely to refining resumes, honing skills, and facing countless assessments. Yet, the most significant aspect was confronting rejection. Rejections felt like heavy boulders weighing down upon us, and the fear of facing unemployment loomed ominously. It was a trying period, one filled with uncertainty and apprehension. </p> <p> The golden four years of college life have come to an end. No more night outs before exams, relentless cramming, assignment submissions, record books, projects, or last-minute sprints to meet deadlines. No more gossiping, bunking classes, asking dad for pocket money, or dancing in the last seats of the college bus. We were free souls back then, a truth we fully appreciated only once it was all over. It's often the case that the value of a moment becomes clear only in hindsight. Though I am no longer a student, I will forever be a learner. I learned that <i> 'studying' might feel like it‚Äôs killing you (since it contains 'dying'), but 'learning' is what truly makes you 'earning' (l'EARNING') </i>. Just a little insight I came up with along the way üëª. Now, I stand as a <em> grown-up </em> (Can I say so?ü§î), an <b> INDEPENDENT WOMAN </b> (I guessüòâ). In conclusion, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to everyone I have crossed paths with on this beautiful journey. Thank you for being a part of this incredible chapter in my lifeüôè.</p>", dateTime: "22:11 23-05-24" }
